\section{Introduction and Objectives}
\label{sect:introduction}
In this experiment, we investigate a technique for multi-category classification based on binary
classifications. The technique is then applied to Fisher`s 3-class datasets of Iris plants to
demonstrate its effectiveness. The dataset of Iris plants to be used in this experiment was created
and published in 1936 by R. A. Fisher [1]. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced
frequently to this day, as a matter of fact the dataset is arguably the best-known in the pattern
recognition literature [2]. The dataset includes features of 150 Iris plants of 3 species known as
Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, where each sample Iris is represented by a 4-dimensional vector
in terms of lengths and widths of the sepal and petal of the flower.
