\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
From our analysis we can see that Linear Binary Classifier works really well for multi-category classification. Calculating the optimal parameters of linear function $f(x,w,b)=w^Tx+b$ that best separate class P from class N using the solution of linear equation $\hat{X}^T\hat{X}\hat{w}=\hat{X}^Ty$ really increase the speed of the calculation rather than using ``for'' loops. Although the result was very promising, the experiment was conducted in controlled dataset thus limiting our assumption of performance with variety of other datasets. The performance of other classification techniques such as SVN is also worth exploring.
