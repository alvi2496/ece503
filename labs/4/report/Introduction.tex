\section{Introduction and Objectives}
\label{sect:introduction}
The goal of this experiment is to develop a computer program for automatic diagnosis of breast
cancer based on logistic regression where the logistic loss function is defined by a dataset
provided by Dr. Wolberg from General Surgery Department, University of Wisconsin,
Madison, WI in 1990â€™s. The dataset contains 30 carefully selected features from each of 569
patients [R1],[R2]. The same dataset has also been made available from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository [R3]. The parameters in the logistic regression model are optimized by
minimizing the logistic loss function mentioned above. In this experiment, the optimization is
performed using the gradient descent (GD) algorithm.
